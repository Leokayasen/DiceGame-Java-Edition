# DiceGame-Java-Edition
A remake of my old Dice Game project from GCSE Computer Science, now in Java!
- - -
Current Features:
- Enter an integer to set dice type
- Click "roll" and read output

Planned Features:
- Visual using 2.5D (no idea how possible this is, but I will try!)
- Dice Type Formatting, making switching between dice types easier and simpler

- - -
Development and Testing is done via `IntelliJ Ultimate 2024.2.4`

A Java Remake of my [Python DiceGame](https://github.com/Leokayasen/DiceGame/tree/main)
