# DiceGame-Java-Edition
A remake of my old Dice Game project from GCSE Computer Science, now in Java!
- - -
Current Features:
- Rolls a single standard (1-6) dice
- Outputs result

Planned Features:
- Dice Selection
  - This includes adding support for different types of dice like D20, D12, etc
- Visual using 2.5D (no idea how possible this is, but I will try!)

Next Update (TBC Date):
- Choose between Terminal and Swing modes
  - Terminal mode means the game and input/output will be through a terminal window
  - Swing mode means it will generate a GUI and handle input/output with that

- - -
Development and Testing is done via `IntelliJ Ultimate 2024.2.4`
